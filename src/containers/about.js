      This project is built using React and Facebookâ€™s
      <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">
        Create React App
      </a>
      which proved to be a wonderful platform for building fast, responsive and
      beautiful looking webapps. You can check out my{' '}
      <a href="https://github.com/ereide/home_page_react"> Github repo </a> for
      this project. To speed up loading time of the webpage I am using
      asynchronous loading. I am also using React-Bootstrap extensively making
      my page responsive on mobile devices as well. The routing is done using
      react-router-dom.
