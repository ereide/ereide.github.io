      'During my time at Swift Navigation I was working in the Estimation team. I was set to reasearch algorithms to detect up to multiple satellite signal errors and then implement it in their Python prototyping environment. I successfully implemented a method to detect when signals were statistically unlikely by calculating the chi squared statistic from the residual terms and the residual covariance matrix and then testing it against a threshold calculated from the given accepted probability of false alert.'

    secondParagraph={
      'I was also set to develop an algorithm to detect cycle slips in the carrier phase tracking. By using calculated doppler shift values from single differenced carrier phase measurements, I could use an iterative least squares to estimate the velocity and clock drift shift, and the residual. From that I could use some of the same outlier detection algorithms from before to decide which signals were likely to originate from cycle slips. The algorithm I developed was able to successfully correctly detect and exclude several cycle slips simultaneously with a very low probability of false alerts and wrong exclusions.'

      At Nexans I have been assigned projects encompassing physical modelling
      and developing software to calculate or predict these phenomenons. These
      projects include creating a simple finite element program for determining
      heat conduction within cables to assist manufacturing. I did also work on
      a program to improve the measurements of resistance, capacitance and
      inductance using the Telegrapherâ€™s equations. I was also assigned a
      project to try to investigate a recurring problem of some cables being
      uncoilable for storage. To assist the design and manufacturing of these
      cables I developed intuitive computer programs for calculating these
      effect. These programs are widely used today within the company.
